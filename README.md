# Predicting Genetic Disorders Using Genomic Data

### About the Project
Genetic disorders are a significant health concern caused by mutations in DNA or chromosomal changes. These disorders often remain undiagnosed due to their complexity, leading to delays in treatment. This project aims to address this issue by developing a machine learning model capable of predicting genetic disorders based on patient genomic data. By leveraging this predictive model, we hope to facilitate early diagnosis, improve treatment planning, and ultimately enhance healthcare outcomes.

This project encompasses the following key objectives:
1. Analyze a genomic dataset to uncover patterns associated with genetic disorders.
2. Use machine learning techniques to predict the type of genetic disorder and its subclass.
3. Visualize trends and relationships within the dataset to gain actionable insights.
4. Deploy the final solution via a web-based interface for real-world accessibility.

### Dataset
The dataset contains medical records of children with genetic disorders. It includes demographic information, symptoms, and inheritance patterns. The dataset comprises two main files:
* train.csv: Training dataset with labeled instances for supervised learning.
* test.csv: Testing dataset for model evaluation.

### Data Features:
* __Demographic Information:__ Age, gender, and related details.
* __Symptom Patterns:__ Medical symptoms linked to disorders.
* __Inheritance Information:__ Genetic inheritance patterns.
* __Target Variables:__
  * __Genetic Disorder:__ The primary disorder category.
  * __Disorder Subclass:__ Subclassification of the disorder.

### Project Workflow
1. __Data Exploration and Visualization:__
    * Analyze the distribution of genetic disorders and their subclasses.
    * Visualize relationships between features and target variables using tools like pie charts, count plots, and heatmaps.

2. __Data Preprocessing:__
    * Handle missing values and outliers.
    * Perform feature encoding for categorical variables.
    * Apply scaling and normalization techniques to prepare data for model training.

3. __Feature Selection:__
    * Identify the most significant features affecting predictions using correlation analysis and feature importance metrics.

4. __Model Development:__
    * Train supervised learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting).
    * Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    * Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

5. __Deployment:__
    * Integrate the predictive model into a user-friendly web application for showcasing results and insights.

### Inferences from the Dataset

* __Prevalence of Genetic Disorders:__ Certain disorders are more frequent, suggesting areas of focus for medical intervention.
* __Symptom Patterns:__ Specific symptoms strongly correlate with certain genetic disorders, aiding in early diagnosis.
* __Inheritance Trends:__ Patterns in inheritance data highlight the likelihood of disorders based on family history.
* __Feature Importance:__ Demographic and symptom-based features significantly impact predictions, guiding feature selection.

### Tools and Libraries
* __Language:__ Python
* __Libraries:__ Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* __Environment:__ Jupyter Notebook
* __Additional Tools:__ Kaggle for dataset exploration
